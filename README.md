# Algorithm
1st code of stack implementation:
1) Node Class: Represents a single linked list node with value and pointer next.
2) Constructor: Initializes a node with given data and sets next to NULL.
insertAtHead Function:
3) Creates a new node.
Sets its next to the current head.
Updates head to point to the new node.
display Function:
4) Traverses the linked list from head.
Prints each node's value followed by " -> ".
Ends with "NULL" to indicate the end of the list.
5) main Function:
Initializes the linked list with head set to NULL.
Inserts values (4, 5, 10) at the head.
Displays the linked list after each insertion
